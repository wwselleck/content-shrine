# 🙏🔥content-shrine🔥🙏
This repo exists to document the best of the best content I come across.

This can be any kind of content: informational, educational, entertaining, funny, whatever
It can also be about anything: programming, technology, sports, video games, anything

✔️ Signals that something is worth adding:
- It is an iconic and/or foundational work of a field I'm interested in
- It details processes or patterns that I aspire to use myself
- It's something worth revisiting frequently
- I get anxiety from the thought that I might lose it or forget about it

❌ Signals that something is **not** worth adding:
- It's a tutorial
- It's the kind of thing that could be easily replaced by whatever the top search on Google is for that topic
- It doesn't vibe 🥺
